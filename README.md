# Handwritten-text-prediction 
PROJECT OVERVIEW 

This project focuses primarily on OCR (Optical character recognition) to accurately identify
and extract handwritten text from seemingly illegible prescription images 
the model is trained to read key information labels like doctor's name , patient's name , date and time etc
the goal is to improve accessibility to read these prescriptions and provide an accurate reading of what 
texts are written 

FEATURES 

This project uses a CNN model called "MobileNetV2" on our sellected dataset
Annotation is done in the notebook file 
Data preprocessing is done for OCR accuracy
Automated visualization of recognized text with bounding boxes
